# SIG CHRONO
> CAA CHRONO Special Interest Group (SIG)

## Statement
> Eythan Levy, Thomas Huet

The objective of the proposed SIG ("Chronological modelling in archaeology [SIG CHRONO]") is to foster research and exchange in all areas related to chronological modelling in archaeology. This includes both theoretical methods and models, as well as practical software solutions and packages. The concerned research topics include (but are not limited to) seriation methods, cross-dating, radiocarbon calibration, Bayesian methods, aoristic methods, Linked Open Time Data (LOTD), stratigraphic modelling, temporal logics, and chronological networks. The SIG would organise a yearly CAA session on chronological modelling (based on the one held at CAA 2023), and would host a monthly virtual meeting to discuss latest advances on this topic and present open problems.
