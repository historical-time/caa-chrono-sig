The ambition of the SIG Chrono is to model temporal processes that underlie archaeological features regardless of the accuracy or fuzziness of temporal data. These archaeological features can be archaeological periods, site stratigraphies, object "chaîne opératoires" or personal genealogies. We aim to create bridges with the SSLA SI and the LOD one. To do so, we aim to back our work on standard formats, such as the Extended Date Time Format, formalisms such as Directed Acyclic Graphs, open-source softwares (in construction), time-period gazetteers such as Periodo, and so on, following the LOD and FAIR principles in a collaborative way.
