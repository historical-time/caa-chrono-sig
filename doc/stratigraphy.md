**Stratigraphic modelling**. The most famous tool for stratigraphic modelling is the Harris matrix (Harris 1989), which has been the focus of much software development ([Harris Matrix Composer](https://harrismatrixcomposer.com/\#/), [Stratify](http://www.stratify.org/index.htm), [Stratifiant](https://abp.hypotheses.org/3965), …). Originally designed as a tool restricted to relative chronology, the Harris matrix has also seen developments aimed at extending this formalism to include absolute dating elements (see for example Desachy 2016). Similar efforts have extended the model’s power to be able to automatically detect temporal relations between stratigraphic units (see for example the [Phaser](http://stratigraphic.github.io/phaser-app) tool).
