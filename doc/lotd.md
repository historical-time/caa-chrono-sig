**Linked Open Time Data (LOTD).** Chronological Linked Open Data provides chronological space-time-gazetteers, e.g. [PeriodO](https://perio.do/en/), [GODOT](https://godot.date/) and [ChronOntology](https://chronontology.dainst.org/), and standard formats and ontologies, e.g. [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/), [OWL TIME](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/)[, EDTF](https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/), and [CIDOC CRM](https://www.cidoc-crm.org/), [Alligator Ontology](https://rgzm.github.io/alligator/vocab/), [AMT Time Ontology](https://github.com/mainzed/academicmetatool-viewer/blob/master/time/ontology\_time.ttl). LOTD and open source research tools allow for reproducible research, the unveiling of â€œhidden assumptions' ' in archaeological data and the semantic modelling of fuzziness and wobbliness. An example could be statistical approaches such as the horseshoe paradigm using correspondence analysis and the application of temporal logics to do temporal reasoning (Madsen 1998; Thiery and Mees 2018).
