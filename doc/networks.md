**Chronological networks.** Until recently, little attention had been brought to the application of deterministic (i.e. non-statistical) techniques to building wide regional chronologies, based on historical data and cultural synchronisms. The goal of such techniques is to automate the archaeological cross-dating process by encoding a network of chronological relationships between temporal entities, and using algorithms to build the global chronology by propagating along the network a set of absolute dates located at specific nodes of the network. This approach has recently been implemented by two software tools: [Groundhog](http://www.groundhogchronology.com/) (Falk 2016, 2017, 2020\) and [ChronoLog](https://chrono.ulb.be/) (Levy et al. 2021a, 2021b), relying on different algorithmic techniques (optimized enumeration and graph-theoretic techniques, respectively).
