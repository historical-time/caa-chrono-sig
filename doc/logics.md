**Temporal logics.** Temporal logics is an important field of mathematical and computer science research (Demri et al. 2016), which has up to now found too little applications in archaeological research, probably due to a lack of communication between the relevant research communities. The main results of temporal logics widely applied and cited by archaeologists (see for example Holst 2004; May 2020\) are the fundamental, but old, Allen relations (Allen 1984, 1991). The archaeological research community has otherwise only brought too little attention to recent research results in temporal logics.
