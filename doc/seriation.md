**Seriation techniques.** A classical way to provide relative chronology between artifacts, even in the absence of stratigraphic information, is seriation (Oâ€™Brien and Lyman 1999). In its variant called frequency seriation, the relative frequencies of each type of artifacts found within the same layer are computed and presented in chart form. The relative order between these layers (possibly coming from different sites, thus not featuring a relative stratigraphic order with each other) can then be established using the hypothesis of unimodality of artifact production. Seriation is an old but powerful method, which seems to have fallen out of fashion in many fields of Old World archaeology, but that still saw significant advances in the last decades (see for example Lipo, Madsen and Dunnell 2015).
