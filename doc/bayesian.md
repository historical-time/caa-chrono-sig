**Bayesian modelling.** Bayesian modelling has revolutionized the way radiocarbon dating is practised nowadays (Buck et al. 1991; Bronk Ramsey 2009). The introduction of known priors (e.g., stratigraphic sequences, *termini post/ante quem*) into the radiocarbon calibration process enables researchers to obtain much more precise dating intervals than previously, when radiocarbon samples were individually calibrated rather than incorporated into a model. Many software tools are currently available for Bayesian modelling in archaeology, such as [OxCal](https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal/OxCal.html), [BCal](https://bcal.shef.ac.uk/), [ChronoModel](https://chronomodel.com/), as well as R and Python packages.
