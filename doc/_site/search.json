    "text": "Seriation techniques. A classical way to provide relative chronology between artifacts, even in the absence of stratigraphic information, is seriation (O’Brien and Lyman 1999). In its variant called frequency seriation, the relative frequencies of each type of artifacts found within the same layer are computed and presented in chart form. The relative order between these layers (possibly coming from different sites, thus not featuring a relative stratigraphic order with each other) can then be established using the hypothesis of unimodality of artifact production. Seriation is an old but powerful method, which seems to have fallen out of fashion in many fields of Old World archaeology, but that still saw significant advances in the last decades (see for example Lipo, Madsen and Dunnell 2015).",

LOTD and open source research tools allow for reproducible research, the unveiling of “hidden assumptions’ ’ in archaeological data and the semantic modelling of fuzziness and wobbliness.

The introduction of known priors (e.g., stratigraphic sequences, termini post/ante quem) into the radiocarbon calibration process enables researchers to obtain much more precise dating intervals than previously, when radiocarbon samples were individually calibrated rather than incorporated into a model. Many software tools are currently available for Bayesian modelling in archaeology, such as OxCal, BCal, ChronoModel, as well as R and Python packages.",

Temporal logics is an important field of mathematical and computer science research (Demri et al. 2016), which has up to now found too little applications in archaeological research, probably due to a lack of communication between the relevant research communities. The main results of temporal logics widely applied and cited by archaeologists (see for example Holst 2004; May 2020) are the fundamental, but old, Allen relations (Allen 1984, 1991). The archaeological research community has otherwise only brought too little attention to recent research results in temporal logics.",

    "text": "Chronological networks. Until recently, little attention had been brought to the application of deterministic (i.e. non-statistical) techniques to building wide regional chronologies, based on historical data and cultural synchronisms. The goal of such techniques is to automate the archaeological cross-dating process by encoding a network of chronological relationships between temporal entities, and using algorithms to build the global chronology by propagating along the network a set of absolute dates located at specific nodes of the network. This approach has recently been implemented by two software tools: Groundhog (Falk 2016, 2017, 2020) and ChronoLog (Levy et al. 2021a, 2021b), relying on different algorithmic techniques (optimized enumeration and graph-theoretic techniques, respectively).",

The most famous tool for stratigraphic modelling is the Harris matrix (Harris 1989), which has been the focus of much software development (Harris Matrix Composer, Stratify, Stratifiant, …). Originally designed as a tool restricted to relative chronology, the Harris matrix has also seen developments aimed at extending this formalism to include absolute dating elements (see for example Desachy 2016). Similar efforts have extended the model’s power to be able to automatically detect temporal relations between stratigraphic units (see for example the Phaser tool).",
