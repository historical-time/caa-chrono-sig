> Newsletter 1 – January 2026

Dear member of the CAA SIG Chrono,

We hope this message finds you well. We are glad to inaugurate the newsletter of our [Special Interest Group](https://historical-time.github.io/caa-chrono-sig/) (SIG) on chronological modelling -- SIG Chrono -- with this first issue.

## Meetings & Events

**Next meeting**: The next meeting -- the third -- of the SIG is scheduled for Monday 16 February, 10h-11h, CET. Details will follow.

**Second meeting of the SIG:**

The second online meeting of the SIG took place on 15 December. We were lucky to hear a presentation by Prof. Caitlin Buck and Dr Marta Krzyzanska on "Quantifying Uncertainty in Expert Archaeological Dating Evidence", related to their [QUEADE](https://sheffield.ac.uk/mps/research/maths/queade) research project. The video of the lecture is available [here](https://sdrive.cnrs.fr/s/EDYBHYHtiHqa5fC).

**First meeting of the SIG**: The work of the SIG was kicked off with the first online meeting, which took place on October 27. We had a presentation about "A Computational Approach toward Minoan Chronology: Thoughts on the modelling aspects" by Martina Trognitz, Diamantis Panagiotopoulos, and Iro Mathioudaki.

# Press review

As 2025 draws to a close, we would like to share some articles on chronological modelling published this year, which might be of interest to many of us. Do not hesitate to send us more references, that we can share in the next newsletter.

## SIG Practicalities

**Historical time:** The "[historical-time](https://github.com/historical-time)" GitHub organization hosts the [repository](https://github.com/historical-time/caa-chrono-sig) of SIG Chrono. In the repository, we keep an archive of past meetings and newsletters. The repository serves as the backend of the [SIG's webpage](https://historical-time.github.io/caa-chrono-sig/) were you will also find current information on upcoming meetings and further useful information (e.g. how to subscribe to the newsletter to become a member of this group).

Feel free to share this newsletter with any interested colleagues.

Best wishes to you all for 2026,

_Eythan Levy, Martina Trognitz and Thomas Huet_
