    "text": "S35: Chronological Modelling III: a Round Table on Time in Computational Archaeology\nRound table, 2h30 and 4 tracks:\n\nEpistemology of archaeological time\nArchaeological time in practice: cross dating, anchor dates, cultural periods\nFormats, standards and interoperability\nMathematics, Algorithms and Software\n\n\nThis round table aims to discuss the current challenges and future perspectives in modeling time in archaeology. Each of the following topics will be discussed for 30 minutes and chaired by a different scholar (Joan Antonio Barceló, Keith May and/or James Taylor, Florian Thierry, Joe Roe).\n\nEpistemology of archaeological time | What is the nature of archaeological time (in comparison to historical time)?\n\nArchaeological time in practice: cross dating, anchor dates, cultural periods | How do archaeologists effectively align multi-sourced chronological data (stratigraphic layers, artifact seriations, etc.)?\n\nFormats, standards and interoperability | On reference systems, thesauri, data fusion, etc.\n\nMathematics, Algorithms and Software | On existing IT-based methods for computing temporal data and emerging challenges.\n\nA final 5–10 minute session will be dedicated to discussing the possibility (or not) of developing a Temporal Information System (similar in concept to a GIS for geographical data)."
