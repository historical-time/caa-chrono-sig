Their work is motivated by the ubiquitous problem faced by post-excavation teams as they seek to integrate finds dates into the overall chronology for the site. In general, such date estimates derive from statements in the reports of finds experts, which take the form of a date range, often with a textual qualifier (e.g. probably 43-410 AD). Typically, such reports offer little or no explanation as to precisely what event has been dated, which dates are most likely in the range or what form any extra uncertainty might take. By tailoring well-established, formal knowledge elicitation methods (already in use in sectors such as drug discovery, nuclear safety and climate science), the QUEADE team has developed a suite of protocols and software that can be used to formalise expert knowledge about the dates of cultural finds (such as coins, pottery, tools and items of personal adornment). The approach allows experts to record their knowledge using probability distributions, thus making the associated date estimates rigorous, consistent, readily archivable and viable for inclusion in Bayesian chronological modelling. The goal is to make it much easier for archaeological finds experts to record their knowledge consistently and to be clear with their colleagues precisely what part of the objects life-cycle has been dated.\u0026rdquo; video\nQ\u0026amp;A [10 min], all participants Press review: a review of recent noteworthy publications on chronological modelling [10 min] SIG Chrono Vice-convener election [5 min] Discussion on the SIG Chrono newsletter [5 min] Discussion on SIG Membership [5 min] AOB [10 min] ","date":"2025-12-23","id":11,"permalink":"/meetings/meeting-2/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"sig-chrono---2nd-meeting\"\u003eSIG Chrono - 2nd meeting\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e15 December 2025 at 10am CET time (Paris)\u003c/strong\u003e, total duration: 1h15-1h30, on Google Meet (\u003ca href=\"https://meet.google.com/jza-wncp-bzi\"\u003elink\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"Meeting 2"},{"content":"Welcome to the meetings section.\n","date":"2025-12-23","id":12,"permalink":"/meetings/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWelcome to the meetings section.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"Meetings"},{"content":"SIG Chrono - 1st meeting 27 October 2025 at 10am CET time (Paris), total duration: 1h15-1h30, on ZOOM (link - ⬇️.ics)\nIntro: Eythan Levy (eythan.levy at gmail dot com\u0026gt;\r) and Thomas Huet (thomas.huet at cnrs dot fr\r)\nInvited talk: \u0026ldquo;A Computational Approach toward Minoan Chronology: Thoughts on the modelling aspects\u0026rdquo; [30–40 min], Martina Trognitz (martina.trognitz at oeaw dot ac\r), Diamantis Panagiotopoulos (diamantis.panagiotopoulos at zaw dot uni-heidelberg\r), and Iro Mathioudaki (iro.mathioudaki at gmail dot com\r)\nQ\u0026amp;A [5–10 min], all participants Presentation: Archaeometry \u0026ldquo;Special issue on Chronological modelling\u0026rdquo; (link | slide) [5 min] Thomas Huet and Eythan Levy\nPresentation: CAA2026 round table session S35: \u0026ldquo;Chronological Modelling III: A Round Table on Time in Computational Archaeology (link | slide) [5 min], Thomas Huet, Eythan Levy with the collaboration of Juan Antonio Barcelo, Keith May, James Taylor, Florian Thierry and Joe Roe\nSIG Chrono business [30 min], all participants\n","date":"2025-12-23","id":13,"permalink":"/meetings/meeting-1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"sig-chrono---1st-meeting\"\u003eSIG Chrono - 1st meeting\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e27 October 2025 at 10am CET time (Paris)\u003c/strong\u003e, total duration: 1h15-1h30, on ZOOM (\u003ca href=\"https://cnrs.zoom.us/j/92673181427?pwd=dXeIslab5TbigHQa2ooAGJaOsagBBY.1\"\u003elink\u003c/a\u003e - \u003ca href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/historical-time/caa-chrono-sig/main/sig/meetings/2501027-sig_1st_meeting.ics\"\u003e⬇️.ics\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"Meeting 1"},{"content":"","date":"2023-09-07","id":14,"permalink":"/privacy/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Privacy Policy"},{"content":"","date":"2023-09-07","id":15,"permalink":"/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Welcome to SIG Chrono"},{"content":"","date":"0001-01-01","id":16,"permalink":"/categories/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"0001-01-01","id":17,"permalink":"/contributors/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Contributors"},{"content":"","date":"0001-01-01","id":18,"permalink":"/tags/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Tags"}]
