Their work is motivated by the ubiquitous problem faced by post-excavation teams as they seek to integrate finds dates into the overall chronology for the site. In general, such date estimates derive from statements in the reports of finds experts, which take the form of a date range, often with a textual qualifier (e.g. probably 43-410 AD). Typically, such reports offer little or no explanation as to precisely what event has been dated, which dates are most likely in the range or what form any extra uncertainty might take. By tailoring well-established, formal knowledge elicitation methods (already in use in sectors such as drug discovery, nuclear safety and climate science), the QUEADE team has developed a suite of protocols and software that can be used to formalise expert knowledge about the dates of cultural finds (such as coins, pottery, tools and items of personal adornment). The approach allows experts to record their knowledge using probability distributions, thus making the associated date estimates rigorous, consistent, readily archivable and viable for inclusion in Bayesian chronological modelling. The goal is to make it much easier for archaeological finds experts to record their knowledge consistently and to be clear with their colleagues precisely what part of the objects life-cycle has been dated.\u0026rdquo; video\nQ\u0026amp;A [10 min], all participants Press review: a review of recent noteworthy publications on chronological modelling [10 min] SIG Chrono Vice-convener election [5 min] Discussion on the SIG Chrono newsletter [5 min] Discussion on SIG Membership [5 min] AOB [10 min] ","date":"2025-12-15","id":5,"permalink":"/caa-chrono-sig/meetings/meeting-2/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"sig-chrono---2nd-meeting\"\u003eSIG Chrono - 2nd meeting\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e15 December 2025 at 10am CET time (Paris)\u003c/strong\u003e, total duration: 1h15-1h30, on Google Meet (\u003ca href=\"https://meet.google.com/jza-wncp-bzi\"\u003elink\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"Meeting 2"},{"content":" https://2025.caaconference.org/, 2025-05-05/2023-05-09, Athens\nS1: Chronological modelling II: formal methods and research software Eythan Levy, Thomas Huet\nTime and its analysis are at the heart of archaeology: one of the main objectives of the archaeologist is the establishment of a temporal framework for a given layer, site or material culture.

Duration: 2h30.\nSome 30 years ago, the introduction of GIS into the archaeological toolbox sparked a ‘spatial turn’ in the discipline, greatly improving the interoperability of spatial data. However, no such integrated tool exists for managing temporal data. Chronological methods are highly diverse (e.g., seriation, stratigraphy, cross-dating, absolute dating), each typically handled by different software applications and libraries. The lack of interoperability between software outputs, formats and standards hinders the ability to understand cultural developments across different societies. In our view, the time has come to make chronological data more interoperable through the use of standardised formats (e.g., EDTF), relative temporal relationships (e.g., before/after), and specialised software (e.g., OxCal). Such an approach could pave the way for a Temporal Information System (TIS), enabling the calculation of a temporal metric for the rate of human cultural evolution (see our position paper: Huet \u0026amp; Levy, 2025). We invite all interested colleagues to participate in the open-forum discussion at the round table.\nPosition paper\nHuet, T., \u0026amp; Levy, E. (2025). Foreword – Archaeometry special issue on chronological modelling. Archaeometry, 67(S1), 1–6. https://doi.org/10.1111/arcm.13095\nSession organisation Foreword [5-10 minutes] Thomas Huet and Eythan Levy\nTopic 1: Epistemology of archaeological time [30 minutes] chair: Joan Anton Barcelo\nHistory and Archaeology, sciences of societies in time, are based on the ordering and clustering of events, but differ mainly on the different nature of the proxies they use. History uses mainly authored time-stamped writings (e.g., diplomatic letters, political writings) while Archaeology uses anonymous time-uncertain material culture (e.g., ceramic and stratigraphic sequences). How can such archaeological series be grouped to create periods? To what extent can two periods be considered as contemporaneous ?\nTopic 2: Archaeological time in practice: cross dating, anchor dates, cultural periods [30 minutes] chair: Keith May, James Taylor\nArchaeologists often deal with multi-aligned chronological data: a piece of material culture can be related to a stratigraphic unit containing other objects, to site-wide stratigraphy with groupings and phasing, to broader landscape and/or cultural periodisation, to seriation, to artifact types found in other archaeological cultures, and to so-called ‘absolute’ dates from scientific dating methods (e.g., radiocarbon dates). How, in practice, are these data aligned with each other? How is uncertainty propagated over different chronological assessments?\nBREAK: 15 minutes Topic 3: Formats, standards and interoperability [30 minutes] chair: Florian Thierry\nDeterministic dates, whether seemingly exact (e.g., 79 AD), approximate with uncertainties (e.g., 80/81 AD), or relative (e.g., after 68 AD), can be encoded unambiguously using standards such as ISO 8601, EDTF, or OWL-Time. Such date expressions can serve as the basis for space–time gazetteers (e.g., PeriodO and ChronOntology) and be reused in ontologies (e.g., CIDOC CRM). However, these formats, gazetteers and ontologies cannot directly express probabilistic temporal distributions, such as those derived from radiometric dating. Furthermore, the different ad hoc chronological formats and syntaxes used by chronological software (e.g., OxCal, ChronoModel, or ChronoLog) add a further layer of complexity. How can we foster interoperability between all these formats and standards?\nTopic 4: Mathematics, Algorithms and Software [30 minutes] chair: Joe Roe\nA host of mathematical methods and algorithms exist for both deterministic and probabilistic temporal assessments in archaeology. Software packages (libraries), as well as interactive software applications, are being used to solve a wide variety of chronological problems, such as seriation, Bayesian calibration of radiocarbon dates, or chronological network modelling. Mastering the whole array of available chronological methods, algorithms and tools can be challenging. Is a unified, standardised approach feasible and desirable? And if so, what concrete steps can be taken to achieve it?\nConclusion: Towards a Temporal Information System?
