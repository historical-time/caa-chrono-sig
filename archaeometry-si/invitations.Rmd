Dear ${inv.papers.df[i, 'name']},  
  
We would like to personally invite you to contribute to an (online only) peer-reviewed Special Issue (SI) of the Archaeometry journal, on the subject of '*Chronology: formal methods and research software*'. We were very intrigued by ${inv.papers.df[i, 'topic']}. We were wondering if you would consider a paper on this topic? If you are interested in taking up this invitation, please **let us know by ${inv.papers.df[i, 'Formal.response']}**. If you are unable to undertake this project personally but know someone who might, we would appreciate if you could provide us with their name and contact information. Please note that by agreeing to submit a paper for this issue, you are also agreeing to review at least one paper from the same SI [I WOULD TOTALLY REMOVE THAT LAST SENTENCE [EL]].

Chronology, the analyse of time, is the backbone of Archaeology. Its study material embraces different disciplines however, and is widely dispersed in time and space. This has led to numerous context-based frameworks, focused on absolute vs relative chronology, Prehistory vs recent periods, laboratory techniques vs cultural approaches, deterministic vs statistical methods, and more. The aim of this special issue is to review current practices on formal methods, modelling and research software for chronological data in archaeology. We will invite a series of papers to contribute to various aspects of these matters, including (but not limited to) formal methods, archaeometric dating, Bayesian analysis, stratigraphy, seriation, temporal logics and open-source research software. The papers will also explore multi-paradigm alignment (cross-dating), high-resolution downscaling, low-resolution upscaling of temporal data on a common timeline, multi-resolution alignment (scalability), management of uncertainty and fuzziness, and the incorporation of FAIR policies and isostandards for the reusability of timed data. It is important to note that this special issue is not intended to be a collection of case studies. Instead, it seeks to gather formal perspectives on chronological modelling, review recent methods and avenues of development, and focus on building interoperable chronologies over the long term and at large geographical scales. Please do not hesitate to make contact with us to discuss the potential topic of your contribution in more details.

This SIe digital form also allows the linking of research articles and data samples. That is why we propose an innovative collaboration on the GitHub platform, allowing authors to share interoperable time data compliant with open science standards. The GitHub platform is currently under construction and can be viewed here: https://github.com/historical-time/caa23/tree/main/archaeometry-si.

The final **manuscript submission deadline is ${inv.papers.df[i, 'Soft.deadline']}**.

We hope you will consider contributing to this edition.
 
Yours sincerely,
