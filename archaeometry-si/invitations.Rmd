Dear ${inv.papers.df[i, 'name']},  
  
We would like to personally invite you to contribute to an (online only) Archaeometry Special Issue (SI) on the subject of '*Chronology: formal methods and research software*'. We were very intrigued by ${inv.papers.df[i, 'topic']}. We were wondering if you would consider a paper on this topic? If you are interested in taking up this invitation, please **let us know by the ${inv.papers.df[i, 'Formal.response']}**. If you are unable to undertake this project personally but know someone who might, we would appreciate if you could provide us with their name and contact information. Please note that by agreeing to submit a paper for this issue, you are also agreeing to review at least one paper from the same SI.

Archaeology's backbone is the analyse of time, the chronology. But its study material embraces different disciplines and is widely dispersed in time and space. It has lead to numerous context-based frameworks with different measurements depending on whether the study focused on absolute or relative chronology, Prehistory or recent periods, laboratory techniques or cultural approaches, deterministic or statistical methods, and more. The aim of this SI is to review current practices of formal methods, and research software for time data and chronological modelling, regardless of their precision. We will invite a series of papers to contribute to various aspects of chronological modelling, including (but not limited to) formal methods, archaeometric dating, Bayesian analysis, stratigraphy, seriation, temporal logics and open-source research software. The papers will also explore multi-paradigm alignment (cross-dating), high-resolution downscaling, and low-resolution upscaling of temporal data on a common timeline or multi-resolution alignment (scalability), and management of uncertainty and fuzziness, incorporating FAIR policies and isostandards for time data reusability. It is important to note that this Special Issue is not intended to be a collection of case studies. Instead, it seeks to gather formal perspectives on chronological modelling, review recent methods and avenues of development, and focus on building interoperable chronologies over the long term and at large geographical scales.

This SIe digital form also allows the linking of research articles and data samples. That is why we propose an innovative collaboration on the GitHub platform, allowing authors to share interoperable time data compliant with open science standards. The GitHub platform is currently under construction and can be viewed here: https://github.com/historical-time/caa23/tree/main/archaeometry-si.

The final **manuscript submission deadline is ${inv.papers.df[i, 'Soft.deadline']}**.

We hope you will consider contributing to this edition.
 
Yours sincerely,
